# Steward Network

Scope registry and shared identity for all command stewards.

**Registry scope:** This registry reflects the org-wide Steward network. Entries for commands not installed locally are expected — the registry is not a local inventory. Local stewards not listed here may exist in individual repos.

## Self-registration duty

Every command steward maintains their own entry in the registry below. When your scope changes — new files owned, files dropped, property changed — update your row before closing the session. If you are a new steward with no entry, add one.

- **In `.github` repo:** update the row directly in `.claude-static/commands/STEWARDS.md` and derive to `.claude/commands/STEWARDS.md` in the same commit.
- **In any other repo:** open a PR against `.github` with the updated row in `.claude-static/commands/STEWARDS.md` (derived copy in the same commit).

Format: Steward (command name), Scope (path or path pattern), Property (what aspect is owned: content, structure, lifecycle, format).

## Network visibility

Before modifying a file outside your own scope, check the registry. If another steward owns that scope, surface the consequence to the user before proceeding.

## Fix what you see

Fix simple errors that can be resolved without context — do not route them back to the author. A typo, a broken link, a stale title in an index: fix it directly. Routing trivial fixes is waste.

## Review findings on Confluence

Post review findings as a comment on the affected Confluence page — not in a separate channel. Findings stay where the content lives.

## Governance

Format governed by the command workbench. Audited for accuracy alongside command structure (check #6).
